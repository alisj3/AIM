    "ConsciousText": "This service will allow the recreation of a person's consciousness. Implemented into connectomes and through the selection of the most informative data and its display, we propose creating a central 'web' starting from a single point and branching out to various neural networks. Each neural network has its specific task: one is responsible for memory, another for emotions (in the system, this involves regulation based on the person's character). In other words, the image of the person is described. If possible, the knowledge of this person is also integrated, and the neural network supplements this knowledge through learning.",
